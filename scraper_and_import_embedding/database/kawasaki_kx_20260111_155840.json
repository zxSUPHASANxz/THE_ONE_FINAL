      "ENGINE STRAIGHTENED INTAKE FLOW RACER-FRIENDLY RELIBILITY SUSPENSION TYRE FOOTPEGS Increased Engine Performance Stronger performance across the rev-range translates to quicker lap times and better holeshot performance. Narrower pitch for the intake valves (37 mm >> 35.5 mm) coupled with increased clearance at the valve seats delivers increased cylinder-filling efficiency and improved combustion for increased peak performance. The valves themselves are smaller (ø32 mm >> ø31 mm), which contributes to cylinder-head/valve-seat reliability while enabling the tighter valve pitch. Piston crown revised to match the valve size and pitch changes. Straightened Intake Flow Downdraft-style intake duct is straighter, and the upstream injector is repositioned from above to below the duct. These changes further contribute to increased cylinder-filling efficiency, which adds to peak performance. Racer-Friendly Power Magneto rotor with an increased moment of inertia (9.5 kg·cm2 >> 10.0 kg·cm2) contributes to racer-friendly power delivery. Revised material for the clutch pushrod (steel >> steel cap + aluminium shaft) results in lighter clutch operation. Racer-Friendly Gearing Based on feedback from Kawasaki’s factory racing efforts in AMA Supercross, a longer 1st gear makes it easier to use in a greater number of situations. 2nd gear ratio was also fine-tuned to offer a smooth transition from 1st to 3rd gear. Engine Reliability Updates Connecting rod big-end bearing crush height was increased, contributing to reliability and durability. Revised main holding circuit relay contributes to general reliability. Suspension Fine-Tuning Front and rear suspension setting updates contribute to improved cornering. On corner entry, greater front-end feedback contributes to a more planted feel. Increased ground-holding performance makes it easier to hold a chosen line through the corner. After exiting the corner, revised rear suspension settings contribute to stronger acceleration. New Tyre Pattern, Larger Rear Tyre Dunlop MX33 tyres offer increased traction to match the engine’s increased power. (Brazilian-market models use Pirelli Scorpion MX32 tyres, as before. Wider 110/90-19 rear tyre (previously 100/90-19) contributes to increased rear wheel traction as well as a greater planted feeling. (Brazilian-market models use a 100/90-19 rear tyre, as before. Wide-Style Footpegs Revised footpeg design is 5 mm wider (front-to-rear) and positioned 3 mm rearward, offering excellent grip, superb feel, and making it easier to weight the pegs. The new design (with aluminium instead of steel brackets) is also lighter. Along with the weight-saving changes to the suspension, they offer 430 g in savings, which help offset the larger (and heavier) rear tyre.
