Notes:
- All reported locations were updated to read from environment variables where applicable.
- Do NOT rotate keys until you have updated all systems that depend on them.
- After rotating keys at providers, run the git-history scrub workflow provided in scripts/remove_secrets.sh (I can prepare it next).
